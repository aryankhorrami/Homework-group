        <h3 >About Node JS</h3>
        <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs <br> on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, <br>
             which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript <br> to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to <br>
            produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. <br>
            Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application <br> development around a single programming language, rather than different languages <br>
            for server-side and client-side scripts.
            Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of <br> asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in <br> web applications 
            with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications <br> (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
            The Node.js distributed <br> development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged <br> with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux <br> Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
            Corporate users of Node.js software include <br> GoDaddy, Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Rakuten, SAP, Walmart, <br> Yahoo!, and Amazon Web Services.</p>
